Google Ad Tech Remedies Hearing Concludes; Judge Urges Settlement
On October 6, 2025, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema concluded a two-week remedies hearing in the Google ad tech monopoly case. As we noted in the April edition of this newsletter, Judge Brinkema ruled that Google illegally maintained monopolies in two advertising markets and illegally tied its products together to make it difficult for users to switch to competitors.  
During the remedies hearing, the DOJ argued that “nothing short of a structural divestment is sufficient to bring meaningful change,” proposing that Google 1) divest its ad exchange business (AdX), 2) make the code for publisher tools publicly available, and 3) partially divest its publisher ad network (DoubleClick). Google’s lawyers argued that the DOJ’s proposal was too complicated to implement without harm to publishers and small firms that depend on Google’s technology. Instead, Google proposed behavioral remedies aimed at improving integration with competitor’s products and making it easier for publishers to use rivals’ tools.  
The technical feasibility of the proposed remedies became a central component of the hearing, with battling expert witnesses. Google’s engineering director Glenn Berntson testified that divesting the ad exchange would be “more complex than anything I’ve done in the 10 years at Google,” noting that the system receives 8.2 million requests to sell ad space every second. Government expert Goranka Bjedov, a former Google and Facebook engineer, testified that “a reasonably competent team of 80 engineers can get this done,” drawing on her experience helping integrate Instagram into Facebook after its acquisition.
Judge Brinkema told attorneys for both sides that “my favorite phrase is ‘Let’s settle this case,’” signaling her discomfort with the prospect of untangling the highly technical systems at the heart of Google’s ad tech empire. Without a settlement, Judge Brinkema will be left in a similar position as Judge Amit Mehta previously was in the DOJ’s case against Google’s search monopoly: determining how to restructure a complex market to account for past harms. Judge Brinkema’s ruling could have significant implications for pending antitrust cases against Apple and Live Nation.
Stay tuned: Google plans to appeal the Court’s decision on liability but must first face the judge’s ruling on remedies. Closing arguments for the remedies trial are set for November 17
