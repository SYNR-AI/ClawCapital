## PRESENTATION

### Operator

Welcome, everyone. Thank you for standing by for the Alphabet Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jim Friedland, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

### James Friedland

Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Alphabet's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Sundar Pichai, Philipp Schindler, and Anat Ashkenazi.

Now I'll quickly cover the safe harbor. Some of the statements that we make today regarding our business, operations and financial performance may be considered forward-looking. Such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially. Please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q, including the risk factors. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.

During this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release, which is distributed and available to the public through our Investor Relations website located at abc.xyz/investor. Our comments will be on year-over-year comparisons unless we state otherwise. And now I'll turn the call over to Sundar.

### Sundar Pichai (CEO & Director)

Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a standout quarter for us with robust growth across the company. As you saw at IO, we are leading at the frontier of AI and shipping at an incredible pace. AI is positively impacting every part of the business, driving strong momentum.

This quarter, Search delivered double-digit revenue growth. Our new Search features continue to perform well. AI Mode has launched in the U.S. and India and is going well, while AI Overviews now has over 2 billion monthly users across more than 200 countries and territories and 40 languages. I'll give some more details on Search in a moment.

We continue to see strong performance in YouTube as well as subscriptions, reflecting great momentum across these high-growth businesses. In the U.S., shorts now earn as much revenue per watch hour as traditional in-stream on YouTube. And in some countries, it now even exceeds in-stream's rate. Cloud had another great quarter of strong growth in revenues, backlog and profitability. Its annual revenue run rate is now more than $50 billion. We are seeing significant demand for our comprehensive AI product portfolio.

Of course, this is all possible because of the long-term investments we have made in our differentiated full stack approach to AI. This spans AI infrastructure, world-class research, models and tooling and our products and platforms that brings AI to people all over the world. I'll briefly touch on the AI stack before turning to quarterly highlights.

First, AI infrastructure. We operate the leading global network of AI-optimized data centers and cloud regions. We also offer the industry's widest range of TPUs and GPUs along with storage and software built on top. That's why nearly all GenAI unicorns use Google Cloud. And that's why a growing number, including leading AI research labs like Safe Superintelligence and Physical Intelligence use TPU specifically. Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand from cloud customers.

Next, world-class AI research, including models and tooling. We continue to expand our Gemini 2.5 family of hybrid reasoning models, which provide industry-leading performance in nearly every major benchmark. In addition to improving our popular workhorse model Flash, we debuted an extremely fast flashlight version. We achieved gold medal level performance in the International Math Olympiad using an advanced version of Gemini with Deepting. We can't wait to bring Deepting to users soon. We have some of the best models available today at every price point. Our 2.5 models have been a catalyst for growth and 9 million developers have now built with Gemini.

I also want to mention Veo 3, our state-of-the-art video generation model. It's been a viral hit with people sharing clips created in the Gemini app and with our new AI filmmaking tool Flow. Since May, over 70 million videos have been generated using Veo 3. And we recently introduced a feature in the Gemini app to turn photos into videos, which people absolutely love. It's also rolling out to Google Photos users starting today.

Third, our products and platforms. We are bringing AI to all our users and partners through surfaces like Workspace, Chrome and more. The growth in usage has been incredible. At IO in May, we announced that we processed 480 trillion monthly tokens across our surfaces. Since then, we have doubled that number, now processing over 980 trillion monthly tokens, a remarkable increase.

The Gemini app now has more than 450 million monthly active users, and we continue to see strong growth in engagement with daily requests growing over 50% from Q1. In June alone, over 50 million people used AI-powered meeting notes in Google Meet. And powered by Veo 3, our new short video product in Workspace called Google Vids reached nearly 1 million monthly active users. This month at Samsung Galaxy Unpacked, we announced new Android and AI features that are available on Samsung's latest devices. And we are really pleased with the growth in subscriptions, which got a boost from our Google AI Pro and Ultra plans.

Now some key highlights from Search, Cloud, YouTube and Waymo for the quarter.

First up, this is an incredibly exciting moment for Search. We see AI powering an expansion in how people are searching for and accessing information, unlocking completely new kinds of questions you can ask Google. Overall queries and commercial queries on Search continue to grow year-over-year. And our new AI experiences significantly contributed to this increase in usage. We are also seeing that our AI features cause users to search more as they learn that search can meet more of their needs. That's especially true for younger users.

Let me go deeper on our new search experiences. We know how popular AI Overviews are because they are now driving over 10% more queries globally for the types of queries that show them, and this growth continues to increase over time. AI Overviews are now powered by Gemini 2.5, delivering the fastest AI responses in the industry. We also saw strong growth in the use of multimodal search, particularly the combination of lens or Circle to Search together with AI overviews. This growth was most pronounced among younger users.

Our new end-to-end AI search experience, AI Mode continues to receive very positive feedback, particularly for longer and more complex questions. It's still rolling out, but already has over 100 million monthly active users in the U.S. and India. We plan to keep enhancing the AI Mode experience for users by shipping great features fast. That includes our advanced research tool Deep Search and more personalized responses.

Next, Google Cloud. We see strong customer demand, driven by our product differentiation and our comprehensive AI product portfolio. Four stats show this:

1. The number of deals over $250 million, doubling year-over-year;
2. In the first half of 2025, we signed the same number of deals over $1 billion that we did in all of 2024;
3. The number of new GCP customers increased by nearly 28% quarter-over-quarter;
4. More than 85,000 enterprises, including LVMH, Salesforce and Singapore's DBS Bank now build with Gemini, driving a 35x growth in Gemini usage year-over-year.

Our models have served on our AI infrastructure, which offers industry-leading performance and cost efficiency for both training and inference. Along with our AI accelerators, we introduced new innovations in storage, including Anywhere Cache, which improves inference latency by up to 70% and rapid storage, which delivers a 5x improvement in latency compared to leading hyperscalers. In addition, we have optimized AI software packages, including PyTorch and JAX with full open source supports for various AI training and serving demands.

We've also integrated AI agents deeply into each of our cloud products:

- Wayfair is leveraging our databases integrated with AI to streamline data pipelines and deliver more personalized customer experiences.
- Vantel is leveraging our Gemini-powered data agents and BigQuery to review and act on product feedback more quickly.
- Target is using our Gemini-powered threat intelligence and security operations agents to improve cybersecurity.
- Capgemini is utilizing our AI software engineering agents to deliver higher-quality software faster by automating tasks from code generation to testing.
- BBVA says Gemini and Google Workspace is saving employees nearly 3 hours per week by automating repetitive tasks. It's now rolling it out to 100,000 employees globally.

We are also focused on building a flourishing AI agent ecosystem. We introduced an open source agent development kit, which now has over 1 million downloads in less than 4 months. We also introduced Agentspace, an open and interoperable enterprise chat search and agent platform. Gordon Food Service is bringing Agentspace to its U.S. employees, which is enabling better, more efficient decision-making. And over 1 million subscriptions have been booked for Agentspace ahead of its general availability.

Turning now to YouTube. Nielsen data shows YouTube has led U.S. streaming watch time for over 2 years. A generation that grew up with YouTube on their devices is now increasingly watching their favorite creators and content on their televisions. That includes billions of sports fans, too. Globally, they consume more than 40 billion hours of sports content on YouTube annually. And in September, we'll stream the NFL's first Friday game of the season, live from Brazil.

From sports to shorts, we now average over 200 billion daily views on YouTube Shorts. AI is helping improve our recommendations and auto dubbing, which translates to better returns for creators and brands by dramatically increasing the potential audiences they can reach. And today, we began rolling out a whole draft of new AI tools for creators on YouTube Shorts.

Finally, YouTube continues to diversify its subscription options, recently expanding its premium light offerings to 15 new countries with more to come.

And lastly, Waymo continues to scale and expand to safely serve more riders in more places. Last month, Waymo launched in Atlanta, more than doubled its Austin service territory and expanded its Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay Area territories by approximately 50%. Waymo also launched teen accounts, starting with riders aged 14 to 17 in Phoenix. Overall, great momentum here. The Waymo driver has now autonomously driven over 100 million miles on public roads. And the team is testing across more than 10 cities this year, including New York and Philadelphia. We hope to serve riders in all 10 in the future.

As I said, a standout quarter. A big thank you, as always, to our employees and partners for an amazing Q2. Philipp, over to you.

### Philipp Schindler (Senior Vice President & Chief Business Officer of Google)

Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. I'll quickly cover performance for Google Services for the quarter, then structure the rest of my remarks around the great progress we're delivering across search, ads, YouTube and partnerships.

Google Services revenues were $83 billion for the quarter, up 12% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in Search and YouTube, partially offset by year-on-year decline in network revenues.

To add some further color to our results:

- The 12% increase in Search and other revenues was led by growth across all verticals with the largest contributions from retail and financial services.
- YouTube saw similar performance across verticals. Its 13% growth in advertising revenues was driven by direct response followed by brand.

Starting with search and other revenues, which delivered over $54 billion in revenue for the quarter. Shifts like AI are what propels our industry forward. Gemini's native multimodality is helping bring the offline audio and visual world back into the online world, creating a number of opportunities for Search. Let me share a few examples:

Take visual queries. Google Lens search is one of the fastest-growing query types on Search and grew 70% since this time last year. Majority of lens searches are incremental, and we're seeing healthy growth for shopping queries using lens. And you can obviously take this to the next level by moving from image to video-based capabilities like Search Live.

And then there's Circle to Search, which is now in over 300 million Android devices. We've been adding capabilities to help people explore complex topics and ask follow-up questions without switching apps. For example, gamers can now use Circle to Search while playing mobile games to see an AI overview or answers. And just last week, we brought in new agentic capability directly into search for all U.S. users with AI-powered calling to local businesses.

Finally, shopping: in Q2, we introduced a virtual trial experience for search labs users in the U.S. Now people can try billions of clothing products on themselves virtually. Early results and engagement have been extremely positive, particularly with Gen Z users and we'll be bringing this functionality to all U.S. users imminently.

All these innovations are opening up completely new ways for people to use technology, bringing the offline world into the online world in ways that simply have not been possible before. Add in our amazing AI translation capabilities and just imagine the possibilities. People can access more content in their language, and businesses—large and small, international or local—can reach even more customers. I'm excited about how all of these elements will come together and the opportunities ahead of us in Search.

Moving to ads: our strategy to reinvent the entire marketing process with AI is delivering value for our customers and our business.

- Last quarter, we introduced AI Max and Search, a new suite of AI-powered features in existing search campaigns. Advertisers that activate AI Max and Search campaigns typically see 14% more conversions.
- On media buying, Smart Bidding Exploration—the biggest update to bidding strategy in a decade—brings better performance to advertisers by allowing them to bid on less obvious but potentially higher value queries more often. Campaigns using Smart Bidding Exploration see a 19% increase in conversions on average.
- Demand gen continues to drive revenue growth. For example, Depop (Etsy's resell clothing marketplace) used a short-only demand gen campaign to drive new customers to the site. Shorts drove 80% buyer brand lift and double click-through rates versus benchmarks.
- On creatives, we launched Asset Studio using our latest models to help businesses generate creative assets. Over 2 million advertisers now use Google's AI-powered asset generation tools to run ads, a 50% increase on this time last year.

Turning to YouTube: we saw continued strong revenue growth driven by direct response followed by brand. YouTube creators are connected to global audiences and trusted like no others.

- As part of Brand Connect, we launched Creator Partnership Hub, which allows brands to more easily work with the right creators and tap into cultural moments.
- We introduced Veo 3, photo-to-video and generative effects to Shorts, making content creation easier. We're seeing both the volume and price of ads in Shorts increase, particularly in developed markets.
- McDonald's U.S.A. harnessed YouTube creators to ignite awareness for the Minecraft movie meal. It leveraged YouTube Shorts partnership ads to increase reach, generating a 3.3x higher view-through rate than the industry benchmark.

Finally, on CTV: momentum continues. According to Nielsen's Gauge report, YouTube has been #1 in streaming watch time in the U.S. for more than 2 years, hitting a record high of 12.8% of total TV viewing in June 2025. In the past 12 months, YouTube ads viewed on CTV screens drove over 1 billion conversions. We saw strong growth in retail thanks to CTV shopping ads, which allow viewers to shop directly via QR codes.

As always, I'll wrap up with partnerships. Our customers increasingly recognize the strength and breadth of Google's ability to help them transform their business with AI. For instance, a new partnership with PayPal will improve the digital commerce experience for their merchants and customers. PayPal will expand its Google Cloud adoption for AI-driven recommendations, transaction processing and enhanced security. The partnership also broadens the availability and functionality of PayPal's payment services across a range of Google products.

In closing, I'd like to thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions and commitment to our success, and to our customers and partners for their continued trust. Anat, over to you.

### Anat Ashkenazi (Senior VP & CFO)

Thank you, Philipp. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with the results at the Alphabet level, then cover our segment results, and end with commentary on our outlook for the second half of 2025.

We had another solid quarter in Q2. Consolidated revenue of $96.4 billion increased by 14% (or 13% in constant currency). Search and YouTube advertising, subscription platforms and devices, and Google Cloud each had double-digit revenue growth this quarter, reflecting strong momentum across the business.

- Total cost of revenue was $39 billion, up 10%: Tech was $14.7 billion (up 10%), and other cost of revenue was $24.3 billion (up 10%), driven primarily by content acquisition costs (largely for YouTube) followed by depreciation.
- Total operating expenses increased 20% to $26.1 billion. The biggest driver was expense for legal and other matters, reflecting a $1.4 billion charge related to a settlement in principle of certain legal matters.
- R&D investments increased by 16%, primarily driven by compensation and depreciation expenses.
- Sales and marketing expenses increased 5%, primarily reflecting higher advertising and promotional expenses.
- Operating income increased 14% to $31.3 billion, with an operating margin of 32.4% (benefiting from strong revenue growth and expense efficiencies, partially offset by the legal charge and higher depreciation).
- Net income increased 19% to $28.2 billion, and earnings per share increased 22% to $2.31.

We generated free cash flow of $5.3 billion in the second quarter and $66.7 billion for the trailing 12 months. Free cash flow in Q2 was affected by a sizable sequential increase in CapEx and cash tax payments (we make federal tax payments in Q2 for both Q1 and Q2). We ended the quarter with $95 billion in cash and marketable securities.

#### Segment Results

1. **Google Services**:
   - Revenues increased 12% to $82.5 billion, reflecting strength in Google Search, YouTube advertising and subscriptions.
   - Google Search and other revenues increased 12% to $54.2 billion (growth across all verticals, led by retail and financial services).
   - YouTube advertising revenues increased 13% to $9.8 billion (driven by direct response followed by brand).
   - Network advertising revenue was $7.4 billion, down 1%.
   - Subscription platforms and devices revenues increased 20% to $11.2 billion (driven by YouTube subscriptions and Google One, with paid subscriptions as the biggest growth driver).
   - Operating income increased 11% to $33.1 billion, with operating margin flat year-on-year at 40.1% (partially offset by the legal charge).

2. **Google Cloud**:
   - Revenues increased 32% to $13.6 billion, reflecting growth in GCP (core and AI products) and Google Workspace (higher average revenue per seat and seat count).
   - Operating income increased to $2.8 billion, with operating margin rising from 11.3% to 20.7% (driven by strong revenue and expense efficiencies, partially offset by higher technical infrastructure costs).
   - Backlog increased 18% sequentially and 38% year-over-year, reaching $106 billion (driven by demand from new and existing customers).

3. **Other Bets**:
   - Revenue was $373 million, with an operating loss of $1.2 billion. We're allocating more resources to businesses like Waymo.

#### CapEx & Shareholder Returns

- CapEx in Q2 was $22.4 billion, with nearly all invested in technical infrastructure (≈2/3 in servers, 1/3 in data centers and networking equipment).
- In Q2, we returned capital to shareholders through $13.6 billion in stock repurchases and $2.5 billion in dividend payments.

#### Outlook for H2 2025

1. **Revenues**:
   - At current spot rates, we could see a tailwind to Q3 revenue, but exchange rate volatility may impact results.
   - Google Services advertising: H2 2025 comparisons will be negatively impacted by 2024's strong financial services growth and U.S. Election spend (particularly on YouTube).
   - Cloud: Demand remains high (backlog of $106 billion), but we expect a tight demand-supply environment to persist into 2026.

2. **Investments**:
   - Full-year 2025 CapEx outlook updated to $85 billion (up from $75 billion), reflecting additional server investments, server delivery timing and accelerated data center construction (to meet cloud customer demand).
   - 2026 CapEx is expected to increase further; more details will be provided in a future earnings call.

3. **Expenses**:
   - Depreciation: Increased $1.3 billion year-over-year to $5 billion (35% growth) in Q2; growth is expected to accelerate further in Q3.
   - Headcount: Expected sequential increase in Q3, partially due to new graduate hiring.
   - Q3 will reflect expenses related to the August launch of the new Pixel product family.

In conclusion, we're pleased with the business momentum and excited about the pace of innovation. Our full-stack AI approach positions us well to deliver new products and services. Search revenues are growing with AI-driven features, Cloud has reached a $50 billion+ annual revenue run rate with margin expansion, and YouTube has expanded its addressable market with Shorts (200 billion+ daily views). We're excited to bring value to customers and partners globally. Now I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.

## QUESTION AND ANSWER

### Operator

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.

#### Eric James Sheridan (Goldman Sachs)

Maybe one for Sundar and one for Philipp.  
Sundar: When you think about the journey of product and platform evolution, how do you view the implications of changed consumer behavior—from a volume vs. monetization perspective? Long-standing dynamics around clicks and click monetization may shift over the next 3-5 years.  
Philipp: On YouTube's evolution, you mentioned subscription revenue. How do you think about the ads vs. subscription mix, and what key learnings have you had as subscriptions scale?

#### Sundar Pichai

Thanks, Eric. People are excited about AI and adopting it well across our products. Multimodality—using images via Lens and Circle to Search seamlessly—is an early indication of strong adoption.

On clicks and click monetization, Philipp can elaborate, but overall: we prioritize organic experiences first, and we have a good track record of aligning monetization with these experiences. For newer surfaces like the Gemini app, we'll focus on organic experiences in the near term, but over time (like with AI Overviews and AI Mode), we'll add strong commercial experiences. People have always adapted to these shifts. Philipp?

#### Philipp Schindler

On YouTube subscriptions vs. ads: We value both businesses. Subscriptions are increasingly important, and we'll maintain a long-term focus. We saw strong growth across YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium. A key theme is offering viewers more choice. We deeply understand where ads work best and where subscriptions can complement—we'll continue this dual-tier strategy.

### Operator

Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan.

#### Douglas Till Anmuth (JPMorgan)

One for Sundar and one for Philipp.  
Sundar: You're spending $10 billion more in CapEx this year, yet you mention a tight supply environment. How do you reconcile these?  
Philipp: On search's 12% growth, can you discuss paid click and pricing trends, and how to think about volume vs. monetization going forward?

#### Sundar Pichai

Doug, on CapEx: We're seeing strong momentum, especially in cloud. The supply environment is tight, but our additional investments will take time to materialize (there's a time delay). We're planning ahead to match demand—our comprehensive AI portfolio (models on GPUs and TPUs) is driving significant interest, so we're investing to meet that.

#### Philipp Schindler

On paid clicks: We don't manage to paid click or CPC targets—we focus on user outcomes and advertiser ROI. Some product/policy changes drive better monetization at the expense of paid clicks. In the 10-Q, paid clicks were up 4% year-on-year, but metrics fluctuate due to advertiser spending, product changes, policy shifts and user engagement. It's important not to draw broad conclusions solely from these metrics.

### Operator

Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.

#### Brian Thomas Nowak (Morgan Stanley)

Two questions:

1. Sundar: From a technology perspective, what key hurdles must be cleared to launch scalable agentic capabilities for commercial queries?
2. Any updates on internal efficiency gains from GenAI, and friction points to overcome for these tools?

#### Sundar Pichai

On agentic capabilities: Our Gemini 2.5 models (especially Pro) are heavily focused on this direction. Progress is exciting—including in unreleased models. Key hurdles: chaining events reliably, managing compounding latency and cost, and ensuring consistency for users. We're making robust progress—models are becoming more efficient year-over-year. I expect 2026 to be the year of broad agentic experience adoption.

On internal GenAI efficiency: We're rolling out agentic coding journeys for software engineers. Over the past few months, teams are using more agentic workflows—friction points from earlier have been addressed. We're expanding this to other areas of the company and will roll out similar user journeys externally.

### Operator

Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson.

#### Michael Brian Nathanson (MoffettNathanson)

Two questions for Sundar:

1. At IO, you announced a Warby Parker partnership for glasses. How important are new device cycles to scaling AI, and will more functional devices become essential to consumer experiences?
2. How does Google Search with AI Mode differ from the standalone Gemini app—are there usage or consumer demographic differences?

#### Sundar Pichai

1. New devices will drive AI experiences—AI will unlock innovation in glasses and other form factors. Our glasses investment has delivered dramatic experience improvements, but phones will remain the consumer experience center for at least 2-3 years. We're excited about emerging categories, but phones are still core.

2. AI Mode vs. Gemini app: Overlapping use cases, but distinct strengths. AI Mode excels at information-oriented queries—backed by search, grounded in reliable data, and users respond positively. The Gemini app is more personal: long chats, casual interactions, even therapy-like experiences. Having both surfaces lets us innovate broadly, and over time we'll make the experience more seamless.

### Operator

Our next question comes from Mark Shmulik with Bernstein.

#### Mark Elliott Shmulik (Bernstein)

Sundar: With the AI talent war, how is Google attracting and retaining key AI talent?  
Anat: How do you balance AI-related resourcing costs with increased capital investments for AI?

#### Sundar Pichai

Mark, we've invested in AI talent for over a decade—we have exceptional breadth and depth. Top talent seeks frontier work, access to compute, and collaboration with peers. We're competitive on all fronts: our retention metrics and new hires are healthy. Individual cases make headlines, but our overall talent position is strong. We'll continue investing in people and compute. Anat?

#### Anat Ashkenazi

AI talent is a critical resource—part of our full-stack advantage. It's reflected in operating expenses across the organization. We offset investment growth by driving efficiency: using AI tools internally, running the company with discipline, and optimizing execution. This allows us to allocate research resources appropriately.

### Operator

Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays.

#### Ross Adam Sandler (Barclays)

Two questions:

1. With AI Overviews and new SERP formats reducing ad impressions per SERP, how confident are you in driving CTR for monetization going forward?
2. You're working with OpenAI on cloud infrastructure—how might this relationship expand?

#### Philipp Schindler

On CTR and AI Overviews: AI Overviews drive higher user satisfaction and search usage—scaled to 2 billion users in 200+ countries. Monetization rates are similar to traditional formats, providing a strong base for next-generation ad innovations. That's our current focus.

#### Sundar Pichai

On OpenAI: We're excited about our Google Cloud partnership. Google Cloud is an open platform—we have a history of supporting startups, AI labs and great companies. We look forward to investing more in this relationship and growing together.

### Operator

Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with Evercore.

#### Mark Stephen F. Mahaney (Evercore)

Two questions:

1. Philipp: How would you describe the H2 ad environment vs. last year—more or less uncertain? Any unusual concerns?
2. Sundar: Your two-surface Search approach (Search + Gemini app) – what internal metrics make this optimal vs. a unified search that discerns intent from queries?

#### Philipp Schindler

On the H2 ad environment: Q2 ad performance was strong, led by retail, financial services (insurance) and healthcare. We're only a few weeks into Q3—it's too early to comment on H2 trends.

#### Sundar Pichai

On two surfaces: They cover the full breadth of user needs. Search is information-focused; the Gemini app is a personal, proactive assistant (e.g., deep dives, video creation). We have experience unifying experiences (e.g., Universal Search for text/images/videos). In this early AI paradigm, we want to meet users where they are. Over time, we'll simplify and serve them better—but dual surfaces are optimal today.

### Operator

Our next question comes from Ken Gawrelski with Wells Fargo.

#### Kenneth James Gawrelski (Wells Fargo)

Two questions:

1. You previously said cloud supply constraints would ease by end-2025, but now mention easing into 2026. Can you clarify the H2 cloud outlook after strong Q2 growth?
2. Will agentic experiences democratize the web (like Search did 20 years ago) or lead to more concentration among vertical winners?

#### Anat Ashkenazi

On cloud supply: We're bringing more capacity online each quarter, with a bigger increase expected toward year-end. This reflects earlier investments—capacity expansion isn't immediate. Cloud growth isn't linear: quarter-over-quarter rates depend on capacity delivery timing.

#### Sundar Pichai

On agentic experiences: They'll deliver better user experiences—expanding access and use cases like early web Search. But it's not just technology: we need to solve business models for all players. Savvy players will leverage these experiences to grow, but democratization elements are present.

### Operator

And our last question comes from Justin Post with BAML.

#### Justin Post (BofA Securities)

A couple for Sundar:

1. Gemini subscriptions are a focus—how are they tracking, and what will accelerate consumer subscriptions within Google One?
2. With higher CapEx driven by cloud demand, what gives you confidence in CapEx ROI?

#### Sundar Pichai

1. Gemini subscriptions: Google One's value proposition (powered by storage) is strong, and AI plans (Pro/Ultra) have driven accelerated traction—especially since launching Gemini 2.5 Pro. It's a healthy quarter, and we're excited about growth ahead.

2. Cloud CapEx ROI: We deliver significant value via Google Cloud—high customer satisfaction, low churn, and more efficient growth investments. Our margin trajectory reflects this. In the AI era, customer value is growing—supporting healthy ROI on CapEx.

### Operator

And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Jim Friedland for any closing remarks.

### James Friedland

Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you again on our third quarter 2025 call. Thank you, and have a good evening.

### Operator

Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.
